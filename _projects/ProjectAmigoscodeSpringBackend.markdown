## Spring Boot Application
This project showcases my foundational skills in backend development using Spring Boot, following the comprehensive Spring Boot Tutorial by Amigoscode. The application includes:

- Entity Classes: Designing the data model.
- PostgreSQL Integration: Setting up and interacting with a relational database.
- Service & Repository Layers: Implementing service logic and database access patterns.
This project highlights my ability to build and structure backend systems while working with modern frameworks and technologies. As I continue to grow, I will complement this experience with original projects to demonstrate my expanding capabilities.
