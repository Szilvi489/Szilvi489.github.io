# Student Management System (Spring Boot)

A Spring Boot monolithic application designed for managing students, including adding, deleting, updating, and retrieving students from a MySQL database. This project follows a single-module Maven structure and was developed as a learning exercise using Spring Boot, Spring Data JPA, and REST APIs.

---

## Project Overview
This Student Management System is a simple CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) application built using Spring Boot. It allows users to:
- Retrieve all students or search by specific criteria (ID, Email, Age, Name).
- Add a new student to the database.
- Delete a student by name.
- Update a student's email based on their name.

This project follows a monolithic architecture where all logic is contained in a single Spring Boot application and interacts with a MySQL database using Spring Data JPA.

## Technologies Used

| Technology         | Description |
|--------------------|------------|
| Spring Boot 3  | Java framework for building REST APIs |
| Spring Data JPA  | Simplifies database interaction |
| MySQL  | Relational database for storing student records |
| Hibernate  | ORM framework used for JPA implementation |
| Maven  | Dependency management and build tool |
| Postman  | API testing tool |

## Architecture Overview
```
+---------------------+
|  Student Service   |
|  (Spring Boot App) |

         │
         ▼
+---------------------+
|   MySQL Database   |
|  (JPA & Hibernate) |
+---------------------+
```
### Key Components:
- REST Controller → Handles HTTP requests.
- Service Layer → Business logic for managing students.
- Repository Layer → Interacts with MySQL via JPA.
- Entity Layer → Defines the Student model.

## Setting Up the Project
### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-repo/student-management.git
cd student-management
```

### 2. Configure MySQL Database
Ensure MySQL is running, then configure `application.properties`:
```properties
spring.datasource.url=jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/student
spring.datasource.username=root
spring.datasource.password=yourpassword
spring.jpa.hibernate.ddl-auto=update
spring.jpa.properties.hibernate.dialect=org.hibernate.dialect.MySQLDialect
```

### 3. Run the Application
```bash
./mvnw spring-boot:run
```
The application will be available at: [`http://localhost:8080/`](http://localhost:8080/)

---

## API Endpoints
### 1. Retrieve Students
**Get all students:**
```http
GET /api/v1/student
```
Example Response:
```json
[
  {
    "id": 1,
    "name": "Mariam",
    "age": 24,
    "dob": "2000-01-05",
    "email": "mariam@gmail.com"
  }
]
```

Other queries:
```http
GET /api/v1/student/by-id?id=1
GET /api/v1/student/by-email?email=mariam@gmail.com
GET /api/v1/student/by-age?age=24
```

### 2. Add a New Student
```http
POST /api/v1/student
```
Example Request Body:
```json
{
  "name": "John Doe",
  "dob": "1999-12-15",
  "email": "john.doe@gmail.com"
}
```

### 3. Delete a Student
```http
DELETE /api/v1/student?name=John Doe
```

### 4. Update a Student's Email
```http
PUT /api/v1/student?name=Mariam&email=newemail@gmail.com
```

---

## Code Breakdown

### 1. Student Entity (`Student.java`)
Defines the Student model with attributes: `id`, `name`, `dob`, `email`.
```java
@Entity
@Table
public class Student {
    @Id
    @GeneratedValue(strategy = GenerationType.SEQUENCE)
    private Long id;
    private String name;
    private LocalDate dob;
    private String email;

    @Transient
    private int age;

    public int getAge() {
        return Period.between(this.dob, LocalDate.now()).getYears();
    }
}
```

### 2. Student Repository (`StudentRepository.java`)
Handles database interactions using Spring Data JPA.
```java
@Repository
public interface StudentRepository extends JpaRepository<Student, Long> {
    Student findStudentByEmail(String email);
    Student findStudentByName(String name);
}
```

### 3. Student Service (`StudentService.java`)
Contains business logic for fetching, adding, deleting, and updating students.
```java
@Service
public class StudentService {
    private final StudentRepository studentRepository;

    public StudentService(StudentRepository studentRepository) {
        this.studentRepository = studentRepository;
    }

    public List<Student> getStudents() {
        return studentRepository.findAll();
    }
}
```

### 4. Student Controller (`StudentController.java`)
Exposes REST endpoints for managing students.
```java
@RestController
@RequestMapping("api/v1/student")
public class StudentController {
    private final StudentService studentService;
    
    public StudentController(StudentService studentService) {
        this.studentService = studentService;
    }
    
    @GetMapping
    public List<Student> getStudents() {
        return studentService.getStudents();
    }
}
```


## Conclusion
This Student Management System is a simple, Spring Boot-based project that demonstrates how to build REST APIs with Spring Data JPA and MySQL. It follows best practices by using a service layer, repository pattern, and entity classes.
